								<p>Here's what I think gentrification:</p>
								<p>I'm from NYC. Gentrification is everywhere. Even my section of South East Queens is starting to get gentrified (they're building high rise apartments and hotels near the major LIRR station and the end of the F, J, and E trains). The area of Brooklyn my dad is from is completely different than it was even from when I was little. I have family that lives in the projects in Brooklyn and there's a MAC Boutique in walking distance to their building now. So many of my family members are leaving NYC for either Upstate, New Jersey, or Philly. Some are going to the suburbs, since they've actually started to become cheaper that living in the City proper. My godmother is being bought out of her apartment. My uncle spent a 2 years in court with his landlord before he got fed up and just moved. They want our neighborhoods but don't want us. Aaaannnnndddd that was ranty, sorry, but I'm just so fed up with the BS.</p>

								<p>Gentrification in Seattle is at a all time high. They are tearing down buildings that have been around for years and replacing them with 4 sectional apartments. And rent them out at high price They pushed out all of the homeless and POC and moving them down to south. With the homeless having no place to go. It is sad to see people are more concerned about money and build repetitive stuff like more apartment buildings or another Starbucks or McDonald’s. Instead investing the money to help with programs for the homeless EX: shelters</p>

								<p>I live in San Francisco. The black and Latinx population has sharply declined and it’s all due to gentrification. Like the black population is only 4% when it used to be 13% back in the day. The city of San Francisco itself had stupid policies that gave tax breaks to tech companies to encourage them to set up shop here. I wish I could be excited about the first black female mayor of SF but London Breed’s just following in the footsteps of her predecessors and bowing to tech money. Landlords and property management companies rose the rates on everything because they wanted to siphon as much money as they can from new tech workers who entered the city. The landlords loved making renters miserable. Kicking as many long term renters via illegal evictions out as they could. “Mysterious” fires happened in the once mostly working class/low income, Latinx populated Mission district. Even well-loved businesses shutter because landlords increase the leases on properties to astronomical rates. You see a lot of vacant storefronts because no one can afford to lease these spaces out. I see tent cities and homeless encampments where I’d never seen them before and I’ve lived here for 15 years. Gentrification has spread all over the Bay Area. Anywhere there is access to public transportation. Traffic is now the worst I’ve ever seen. The only reason I am able to still live here is that I switched from print to tech. Did I sell out? Maybe. But let’s be real. I needed to survive. It pays well enough and for the first time I was able to not be living check to check for my old rent controlled studio I’d lived in since leaving grad school. I had hoped that my tech salary would get me out of my tiny studio and into a bigger place, but by that time literally every place was going for $3000 a month. When I got engaged last year, I was adamant about finding a home ASAP. Home prices climb at a crazy rate every year but with a dual income, we had a chance to get a starter home. That’s why my husband and I are able to both still live and work in SF.</p>

								<p>Gentrification is trash because people fix neighborhoods just so white people can come live here. Black and brown people deserve to have their needs catered to as well. When my mom was a child, there was a lot of “white flight” and the neighborhoods were no longer well taken care of. Now gentrification in Birmingham is rising , and bars/restaurants/and other fun things are getting closer and closer to black neighborhoods. That’s a sign of prices going up.</p>

								<p>There is a two fold to this genetrifaction. The pro factor is bringing in a more diversified businesses to the community. The con is gentrification will lead to moving out minorities who has been in the communities for years then pushing them out for the high cost of rental property. This becomes unaffordable which will now cause homelessness for the expanding rents</p>
